            <h2>Scenario</h2>
            <p>
                A team is developing a travel guide website aimed at providing comprehensive information about various tourist destinations. The website includes sections for popular attractions, travel tips, local cuisines, and an interactive map. The project involves both <span class="terminology">client-side web development</span> and <span class="terminology">server-side web development</span>.

            <h2>Problem 1: Broken Links on Web Pages</h2>
            <p>
                During the development process, the team notices that some hyperlinks are not working correctly, leading to 404 error pages. This problem arises due to the incorrect use of <span class="terminology">relative path names</span> versus <span class="terminology">absolute path names</span>. For instance, some team members have used absolute paths that are dependent on the local development environment, which do not translate correctly when deployed to the production server.
            </p>
            <h3>Solution</h3>
            <p>
                To resolve this issue, the project lead organizes a workshop to educate the team on the importance of using <span class="terminology">relative path names</span> for internal links and <span class="terminology">absolute path names</span> for external links. The lead explains that relative paths ensure links work consistently regardless of the environment (local or server), whereas absolute paths are necessary for linking to external resources. By standardizing the use of paths, the team can eliminate broken links and ensure a seamless user experience.

            <h2>Problem 2: Inconsistent HTML Semantics</h2>
            <p>
                Another issue encountered is the inconsistent use of HTML tags, with some team members using &lt;div&gt; tags for everything instead of appropriate <span class="terminology">HTML semantic</span> elements. This leads to a webpage that is not only harder to maintain but also less accessible to users with disabilities and less optimized for search engines.
            </p>
            <h3>Solution</h3>
            <p>
                To address this, the project lead conducts a code review session where the benefits of using semantic elements like &lt;header&gt;, &lt;nav&gt;, &lt;main&gt;, &lt;section&gt;, &lt;article&gt;, and &lt;footer&gt; are highlighted. Examples are shown of how replacing generic &lt;div&gt; tags with these semantic elements improves the document structure and accessibility. By adopting semantic HTML, the website becomes more intuitive, easier to navigate, and more likely to rank higher in search engine results.

            <h2>Terminology</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><span class="terminology">Client-side web development</span>: Involves the creation of the parts of a website that users interact with directly, such as the layout, design, and interactive elements.</li>
                <li><span class="terminology">Server-side web development</span>: Involves managing the behind-the-scenes aspects of a website, such as database interactions and server logic.</li>
                <li><span class="terminology">HTML semantics</span>: The practice of using HTML elements that clearly describe their meaning in a human- and machine-readable way.</li>
                <li><span class="terminology">Relative path</span>: A way to specify the location of a file relative to the current documentâ€™s location.</li>
                <li><span class="terminology">Absolute path</span>: A way to specify the location of a file using the full URL or absolute directory path.</li>
